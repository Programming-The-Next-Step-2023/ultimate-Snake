# ultimate-Snake
This is going to be ~the ultimate~ snake game 

Project description:
I will create a game, based on the same principle and following the same rules as the classic game (originally from nokia I believe) known as "snake". 

Details such as colours, speed variations and game over rules still need to be added (not sure how specific this first description is supposed to be since I assume everyone is familiar with the game).
